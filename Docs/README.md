## Wireframes (Balsamiq)

I created the wireframes for this site with Balsamiq. All wireframes can be found in the folder called [Docs](https://github.com/techistem/alaska2/tree/main/Docs).
The wireframes should not be considered finished product, but as a tool I used as inspiration when creating the website.
