This website was established to help those who want to explore the unique geography of Alaska, its pristine landscapes and iconic wildlife. This is a project for
a course in Html and CSS for the Code Institute by Istem Karakas.

The purpose of this website is to demonstrate my skills in Html and CSS. The target audience is anyone who wishes to explore new places and have exciting
adventures.

## Wireframes (Balsamiq)

I created the wireframes for this site with Balsamiq. All wireframes can be found in the folder called [Docs](https://github.com/gStarhigh/pro1/tree/main/assets/balsamiq).
The wireframes should not be considered finished product, but as a tool I used as inspiration when creating the website.
